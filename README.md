# Blob Climbers
This is my first attempt at a game in Python 3. It is very simple and doesn't really have an objective yet, but it's atleast a proof of concept.

## What I learnt
 - Using pygame to create a game
 - Applying knowledge learnt from mechanics in Maths to create a simple physics engine (i.e. gravity)
